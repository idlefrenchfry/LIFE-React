# LIFE - A React Project

## Introduction

During my internship at Trampolene Ltd, there was a customer managing athletes from all disability groups for a wide range of sports. Additionally, they hold many events in order to spread awareness about sports for disabilities. Everything was being managed through the use of paper which could lead to a lot of issues (loss of documents, misread handwritten documents, incomplete paperwork, etc.).

Customer Requirements
Company C wants a centralized management platform for their staff to

<ol>
  <li>Capture the information of athletes and coaches more effectively.</li>
  <li>Make the planning of training schedules easier.</li>
  <li>Ease the process of creating events and notifying current athletes about it.</li>
  <li>Reduce the manual operations overhead and minimal duplication of documents and data across organization.</li>
</ol>

Information can be shared between professionals across entities on the platform, while keeping internal information strictly within the entity.

## Background
I was tasked to create a website for an existing project. This website was to be a prototype for another design they were considering. Given that this was a prototype, dummy data was used and it isn't fully functional. This was coded using ReactJS.

## Setup
<ol>
  <li>In the command line, go to the project directory and download all the dependencies using <code>npm install</code> or <code>npm i</code></li>
  <li>Start the client using <code>npm start</code></li>
<ol>
